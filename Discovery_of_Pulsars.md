# Discovery of Pulsars

In 1967, a Cambridge University Ph.D. student named Jocelyn Bell discovered something unusual in her radio astronomy data—a faint blip from one part of the sky, repeating every 1.3 seconds with remarkable precision. Its uniformity led Bell and her supervisor, Anthony Hewish, to nickname the discovery **"LGM-1"** for "Little Green Men." Though they doubted it was an alien signal, they struggled to explain such a regular pattern from space.

As it turned out, a theoretical explanation had been proposed more than 30 years earlier, awaiting experimental validation. In the 1930s, astronomers **Walter Baade** and **Fritz Zwicky** sought to explain supernovae—stupendous explosions marking the death of certain stars, sometimes briefly outshining entire galaxies. When the neutron, a subatomic particle, was discovered in 1932, Baade and Zwicky recognized it could solve their puzzle. They hypothesized that when a large star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it rapidly collapses under its own gravity. The star's core transforms into an incredibly dense ball of neutrons, while the outer layers rebound in a massive explosion of light and energy—a supernova. The dense core left behind, dubbed a **neutron star**, would contain the mass of two or three suns compressed into the size of a large city.

For decades, however, neutron stars were assumed to be too dim to observe directly. But in the 1960s, astronomers realized that when a star collapses in this way, two interesting things occur:

1. **Increased Rotation**: Stars typically rotate once every few days, but conservation of angular momentum dictates that when a star collapses, its rotation speeds up. Thus, a neutron star could spin from once a second to even hundreds of times per second.

2. **Intense Magnetic Fields**: Like Earth, stars have magnetic fields that intensify upon collapse, creating incredibly strong magnetic fields in neutron stars. Charged particles in the hot plasma surrounding a neutron star would be funneled toward its magnetic poles and ejected into space as two intense beams.

These concepts combined make a neutron star resemble a lighthouse: spinning rapidly and flashing energy beams across the universe. Suddenly, the signal Bell and Hewish detected with their radio telescope made sense. Instead of "little green men" contacting Earth, the pulses they observed were the beams of a spinning neutron star sweeping past Earth every 1.3 seconds. Further observations revealed more spinning neutron stars, some slower and others much faster. They named these fascinating objects **pulsars**.

**Key Points:**

1. **Discovery**: Jocelyn Bell, a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University, discovered a repeating radio signal every 1.3 seconds in 1967, initially nicknamed **"LGM-1"** for "Little Green Men."

2. **Theoretical Background**: Astronomers Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky had theorized neutron stars in the 1930s as remnants of supernovae, with intense density and mass.

3. **Neutron Star Formation**: When a large star exhausts its fuel, it collapses, forming a dense core called a **neutron star**, and triggers a supernova explosion.

4. **Key Characteristics of Neutron Stars**:
   - **Increased Rotation**: Collapsed stars spin rapidly due to conservation of angular momentum.
   - **Intense Magnetic Fields**: The collapse strengthens magnetic fields, channeling charged particles into beams.

5. **Pulsar Analogy**: Neutron stars act like lighthouses, with beams of energy sweeping through space due to their rapid spin and magnetic poles.

6. **Naming of Pulsars**: The observed regular signals were identified as neutron stars, now termed **pulsars**, with a range of rotation speeds.
